  YOUR WORK:

  You will complete the function setup_main_stack below. Missing code
  and calculations are expressed with a questionmark (?). The
  assignment is mostly about doing the correct math. To do that math
  you will need to learn or understand:
  
  - How the stack is used during program execution
  - How the stack is expected to look like at start of a C-program
  - What a pointer variable is, how it is used
  - How a C-array (pointer to many) is laid-out in memory 
  - How pointer arithmetic behaves
  - How to cast from one pointer type to another
  - How to use printf to print good debug information
  - How to use a C-struct, both object and pointer to

  Some manual-pages of interest:

  man -s3 printf
  man -s3 strlen
  man -s3 strncpy
  man -s3 strtok_r

  The prototype for above functions:
  
  int printf(const char *restrict format, ...);
  size_t strlen(const char *s);
  size_t strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t dstsize);
  char *strtok_r(char *s1, const char *s2, char **lasts);
  
  The above functions exist in Pintos code. Note the Pintos use
  'strlcpy' instead of 'strncpy'. If 'dst' is large enough they behave
  identical. You can find Pintos implementations in
  /home/TDIU16/labs/skel/pintos/src/lib, see string.c and stdio.c. It
  is strongly recommendable to look at the strtok_r examples given in
  string.c

  Recommended compile command:
  
  gcc -m32 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu99 -g setup-argv.c
